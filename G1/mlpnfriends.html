        <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><em>My Little Pony N' Friends</em> is the first form of animated media that the franchise has published,
            beyond simple
            marketing media such as advertisements for the toys; which existed before. It served as the pilot for the
            entire franchise and included a feature length special that was recorded on February 6th, 1984, known as
            Rescue at Midnight Castle</p>
        <p>I personally was not born yet when this show aired, however I did get a chance to delve deeper into <em>My
            Little
            Pony N' Friends</em> as an adult. There are a couple of takeaways I have from my cursory research into this
            generation before my time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The character design is drastically different compared to modern renditions
                <ul>
                    <li>features more full, equine inspired designs rather than the more cartoonish takes on pony
                        designs in modern day
                    </li>
                    <li>More closely mirrored proportions of the dolls</li>
                    <li>Smaller, cute eyes</li>
                    <li>Pastel, soft colors</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The only generation that features humans living alongside ponies, save for Equestria Girls in generation
                4.
            </li>
            <li>Pastel color palette, but not overly bright like future generations</li>
            <li>More fantasy oriented plot direction and feel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general however, I personally find that looking at this show from my hindsight perspective, it gives a
            certain nostalgic feel that I can't quite put my finger on. While I certainly love children's cartoons and
            many other forms of media, my experience watching <em>My Little Pony N' Friends</em> felt uniquely personal
            to
            me. At the very least, it made me feel introspective about my own childhood, and made me wonder what it
            would have felt like to grow up with <em>My Little Pony N' Friends</em> rather than <em><a
                    href="../G4/fim.html">My Little Pony:
                Friendship is Magic</a></em></p>

        <p>In conclusion, I found <em>My Little Pony N' Friends</em> to be a lovely and charming experience as a
            lifelong fan of the My Little Pony franchise. See some additional information and my thoughts below.</p>
