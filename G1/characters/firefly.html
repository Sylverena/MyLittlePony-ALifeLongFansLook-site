        <p>Firefly is the star of <em>Rescue at Midnight Castle</em>, and appears only in this special. Despite this,
            since she appeared in the first special of the series, Firefly is considered by many to be an iconic
            character. Additionally, a large amount of merchandise was based on her design and character.</p>

        <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Personally, I feel that Firefly serves as a wonderful and strong protagonist and role model for viewers.
            While the scope and targeted audience of <em>My Little Pony N' Friends</em> was limited to young girls, I
            feel that was and still is important to portray female characters in strong, leading positions and not only
            relegated to supportive roles. This is a pitfall that many modern children's media still falls into today
            (looking at you, <em>Paw Patrol</em>). I feel that it is important to model to children that anyone,
            regardless of gender, can be a strong capable leader and a force for good. Beyond this, I feel it is an
            archaic practice to sort cartoons to be 'for girls' or 'for boys'. Cartoons should be for everyone.
        <p>Design-wise, I feel there isn't too much to say, except that I generally have a fondness for the way ponies
            look in generation 1. Firefly is no exception. Purple and Pink are my two most favorite colors and lo,
            Firefly has both of those.</p>
