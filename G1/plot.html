        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Echoing my sentiments in the <a href="mlpnfriends.html">MLP N' Friends hub page</a>, I generally feel that
            the plot direction of <em>My Little Pony N' Friends</em> to be quite engaging as an adult viewer. Granted, I
            generally enjoy children's cartoons, so I may have some bias. Regardless, thinking from the perspective of a
            outsider, I feel that generation 1 is generally more approachable than the more 'girly' iterations of
            generation 2 and 3. While the show has and still is targeted towards young girls with the intent to sell
            toys, the more adventure oriented plot combined with fantasy elements may engage both parents and siblings
            of a young girl watching this show.</p>

        <p>I feel that it is still nonetheless important to consider this under the lens of gender roles between the 80s
            and now. Generally speaking, consciousness about social causes such as feminism and intersectionality are
            much further along today compared to the 80s. Cartoons being 'for girls' or 'for boys' was a commonplace
            idea. Nowadays however, cartoons are categorized a lot more loosely and it is not an oddity for girls to
            watch shows targeted towards boys or vice versa.
        <p>All this is to say, that considering the climate of feminism, consciousness of sexism and the dissolution of
            the once rigid barriers between genders, it is remarkable that a show from this era went to such lengths to
            make it approachable to boys and parents as well. This is a good thing, as the show uses its plot devices as
            a vehicle to teach children important values such as respect, tolerance, equality, friendship, and love. The
            creator of generation 4, Lauren Faust, has also cited teaching Love and Tolerance as one of the key goals of
            the series.
        <p>Personally speaking, I find this quite important. While the show was intended to sell toys, its important
            that media that we give children serves more of a purpose than a vehicle for advertisement and profit.
        <p>In conclusion, I found My Little Pony N' Friends to be a surprising and lovely first creation in a series that I love.
